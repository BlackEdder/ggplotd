# GGPlotD

GGPlotD is a plotting library for the D programming language. The design
is heavily inspired by ggplot2 for R, which is based on a general Grammar
of Graphics described by Leland Wilkinson. On the background cairo(D) is
used for drawing. The library is mainly intended to make it easy to
compose complex plots.

## Install

Easiest is to use dub and add the library to your dub configuration file,
which will automatically download the D dependencies. The library also depends
on cairo so you will need to have that installed.

### PDF and SVG support

By default cairoD disables pdf and svg support. To enable it you
need to add a local couple of cairoD that dub can find:

```
git clone https://github.com/jpf91/cairoD.git
sed -i 's/PDF_SURFACE = false/PDF_SURFACE = true/g' cairoD/src/cairo/c/config.d
sed -i 's/SVG_SURFACE = false/SVG_SURFACE = true/g' cairoD/src/cairo/c/config.d
dub add-local cairoD
```

## Extending ggplotd

Due to ggplotdâ€™s design it is relatively straightforward to extend ggplotd to
support new types of plots. This is especially true if your function depends
on the already implemented base types geomLine and geomPoint. The main reason
for not having added more functions yet are time restrains. If you decide to
implement your own function then **please** open a pull request or at least
copy your code into an issue. That way we can all benefit from your work :)
Even if you think the code is not up to scratch it will be much easier for the
maintainers to take your code and adapt it then to start from scrap.


### geom*

In general a geom* reads the data, does some transformation on it and then
plots the transformed result. For reference see below for the geomHist
implementation. That should get you started on designing your own geom
function.

```

### stat*

ggplot2 for R defines a number of function that plot statistics of the data.
GGPlotD does not come with any such functions out of the box, but the
implementation should be very similar to the above named geom* functions. The
main difference will be that a stat function will have to do more data
analysis. If you are interested in adding support for certain statistics then
you should use the geom* functions as a starting point.
