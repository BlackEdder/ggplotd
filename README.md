# GGPlotD

GGPlotD is a plotting library for the D programming language. The design
is heavily inspired by ggplot2 for R, which is based on a general Grammar of
Graphics described by Leland Wilkinson. The library depends on cairo(D) for
the actual drawing. The library is designed to make it easy to build complex
plots from simple building blocks.

## Install

Easiest is to use dub and add the library to your dub configuration file,
which will automatically download the D dependencies. The library also
depends on cairo so you will need to have that installed. On ubuntu/debian
you can install cairo with:

``` 
sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev 
```

### PDF and SVG support

By default cairoD disables pdf and svg support. To enable it you need to add
a local copy of cairoD that dub can find:

```
git clone https://github.com/jpf91/cairoD.git
sed -i 's/PDF_SURFACE = false/PDF_SURFACE = true/g' cairoD/src/cairo/c/config.d
sed -i 's/SVG_SURFACE = false/SVG_SURFACE = true/g' cairoD/src/cairo/c/config.d
dub add-local cairoD
```

## Extending GGplotD

Due to GGplotDâ€™s design it is relatively straightforward to extend GGplotD to
support new types of plots. This is especially true if your function depends
on the already implemented base types geomLine and geomPoint. The main reason
for not having added more functions yet is lack of time. If you decide to
implement your own function then **please** open a pull request or at least
copy your code into an issue. That way we can all benefit from your work :)
Even if you think the code is not up to scratch it will be easier for the
maintainer(s) to take your code and adapt it than to start from scrap.


### geom*

In general a geom* function reads the data, does some transformation on it
and then returns a struct containing the transformed result. In GGPlotD
the low level geom* function such as geomLine and geomPoint draw directly
to a cairo.Context. Luckily most higher level geom* functions can just
rely on calling geomLine and geomPoint. For reference see below for the
geomHist implementation. Again if you decide to define your own function then please
let us know and send us the code. That way we can add the function to the
library and everyone can benefit.

```

### stat*

ggplot2 for R defines a number of functions that plot statistics of the
data. GGplotD does not come with any such functions out of the box, but
the implementation should be very similar to the above named geom*
functions. The main difference will be that a stat function will have to
do more data analysis. If you are interested in adding support for certain
statistics then you should use the [geom* example](#geom*) as a starting
point.
